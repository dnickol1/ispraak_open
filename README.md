iSpraak Open Source

iSpraak is a free and open source online activity generator designed for second language educators. Dr. Dan Nickolai of Saint Louis University developed iSpraak to automate speech evaluation of language learners and to provide them with instantaneous corrective feedback. The National Endowment for the Humanities and the SLU Research Institute have provided funding for its ongoing development and open access. Source Code available on GitHub under the MIT License. Code unique to iSpraak is open source, but this application does rely on other technologies and some proprietary code that is not shared here. PHP and mySQL form the backend of the project. Code that was adapted from tutorials or other open projects are referenced directly in the source code comments of the relevant pages.
